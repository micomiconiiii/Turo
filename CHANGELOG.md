# Changelog - Turo App Development Session

## November 11, 2025

### 🎯 Major Features & Refactoring

#### 1. **User Authentication & Registration System Overhaul**

##### Email Verification System
- **Removed Firebase Auth's built-in email verification** (link-based) to avoid conflicts
- **Implemented custom OTP-based email verification** using Cloud Functions
- Created `CustomFirebaseOtpService` for OTP generation and validation
- OTP emails sent via nodemailer through Cloud Functions (`requestEmailOTP`, `verifyEmailOTP`, `resendEmailOTP`)
- 6-digit OTP with 10-minute expiration stored in Firestore `otps` collection

##### User Registration Flow
- **Added explicit role selection** in `UserRegistrationScreen` ("I'm a Mentee" / "I'm a Mentor" tabs)
- Removed broken heuristic-based role detection (was checking if fullName contains "mentor")
- Updated `AuthService.signUpWithEmailPassword()` to accept 4th parameter: `role` ('mentor' or 'mentee')
- User registration now correctly passes selected role to Firestore
- Added `emailVerificationScreen` route in `AppRoutes`

##### OTP Verification Screen Enhancement
- Made `OtpVerificationScreen` reusable for multiple purposes:
  - **Initial signup verification**: Routes based on user role (mentor → mentor registration, mentee → mentee onboarding)
  - **Institutional verification**: Custom callback to proceed to next step (ID Upload)
- Added optional `onVerificationSuccess` callback parameter
- Updated `institutional_verification_screen.dart` to pass custom navigation callback

#### 2. **User Data Model & Schema Standardization**

##### Field Naming Convention
- **Standardized all Firestore fields to snake_case**:
  - `displayName` → `display_name`
  - `createdAt` → `created_at`
  - `fullName` → `full_name`
  - `profilePictureUrl` → `profile_picture_url`
- Fixed duplicate field issue (was creating both camelCase and snake_case versions)

##### User Model Updates
- **Added `fullName` field** to user data model as required parameter
- Removed `username` field completely from UI and data model
- Updated `UserDetailModel` to include `fullName` field
- `AuthService` now accepts `fullName` parameter in signup
- `DatabaseService.createInitialUser()` refactored to 3-argument signature: `(uid, email, role)`
- Email prefix used as temporary displayName placeholder in `createInitialUser()`

#### 3. **Mentee Onboarding Feature**

##### Multi-Step Onboarding Flow
Created comprehensive mentee onboarding process with multiple steps:
1. **Welcome Step**: Introduction and overview
2. **Goals Step**: Select mentoring goals
3. **Interests Step**: Choose areas of interest
4. **Budget Step**: Set budget range (min/max)
5. **Duration Step**: Select preferred mentoring duration
6. **Personal Info Step**: Birthdate, address, phone number
7. **Profile Picture Step**: Upload or capture profile photo
8. **Confirmation Step**: Review and submit all information

##### State Management
- Created `MenteeOnboardingProvider` using Provider pattern
- Manages all onboarding state across steps
- Handles profile picture file/bytes for web and mobile
- Stores selections: goals, interests, budget, duration, personal details

##### Data Models
- Created `MenteeProfileModel` with:
  - Goals list
  - Interests list
  - Budget map (min/max)
  - Duration string
- `UserDetailModel` stores comprehensive user information:
  - userId, email, fullName
  - birthdate, address, phoneNumber
  - createdAt timestamp

##### UI Components
- Custom step indicator showing progress
- City field with typeahead/autocomplete functionality
- Address fields (Unit/Bldg, Street, Barangay, City, Postal Code)
- Profile picture upload with image picker (camera/gallery)
- Web support with bytes upload, mobile with file upload

#### 4. **Firebase Storage Service**

##### Storage Path Restructuring
- **Changed profile picture storage path**:
  - Old: `users/{userId}/profile_picture/profile.jpg`
  - New: `profile_pictures/{userId}/profile.jpg`
- Updated `StorageService.uploadProfilePicture()` method
- Fixed web upload path in `confirmation_step.dart` to match mobile path
- Updated code comments to reflect new path structure

##### Storage Security Rules
- **Created `storage.rules` file** with proper access control:
  - Users can only write to their own `profile_pictures/{userId}/` path
  - Read access for authenticated users
  - Deny all other paths by default
- Fixed 403 unauthorized errors during profile picture upload

#### 5. **Mentor Registration Flow**

##### Multi-Step Verification Process
Steps include:
1. Basic Information
2. **Institutional Verification** (sends OTP to institutional email)
3. ID Upload
4. Selfie Verification
5. Credentials & Achievements
6. Final Review

##### Institutional Verification
- Validates institutional email (blocks personal domains like gmail.com, yahoo.com)
- Sends OTP to verify institutional affiliation
- Stores institution name, institutional email, and job description
- Optional skip functionality
- Now correctly navigates to ID Upload screen after OTP verification

#### 6. **Database Service Refactoring**

##### Firestore Operations
- Centralized all Firestore operations in `DatabaseService`
- Uses named database `'turo'`
- Batch writes for atomic user creation
- **3-Layer Schema Implementation**:
  - `users` collection (public hub data)
  - `user_details` collection (private data)
  - Future: `mentor_verifications` collection

##### Methods
- `createInitialUser(uid, email, role)`: Creates both users and user_details docs
- `getUser(uid)`: Retrieves user document
- Uses `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` for consistent timestamps

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Authentication & Registration
1. **Fixed mentor role not being set during signup**
   - Was using broken heuristic checking fullName for "mentor" keyword
   - Now explicitly passes selected role from UI tabs

2. **Fixed duplicate email verification systems conflict**
   - Removed `user.sendEmailVerification()` from AuthService
   - Users were receiving both Firebase link AND custom OTP emails
   - Now only sends custom OTP via Cloud Functions

3. **Fixed duplicate Firestore fields**
   - Inconsistent naming caused both camelCase and snake_case versions
   - Standardized to snake_case across all services and models

4. **Fixed institutional OTP verification routing**
   - Was incorrectly trying to route based on role after institutional verification
   - Now uses custom callback to proceed to next step (ID Upload)

#### Storage & File Upload
1. **Fixed profile picture upload 403 error**
   - Missing Firebase Storage security rules
   - Created proper rules file with user-specific write access

2. **Fixed web/mobile path inconsistency**
   - Web was using old path `users/{uid}/profile_picture/profile.jpg`
   - Updated to match mobile path `profile_pictures/{uid}/profile.jpg`

#### Data Integrity
1. **Fixed wrong data in displayName field**
   - Was sometimes showing password or incorrect values
   - Now uses email prefix as placeholder until full name is provided

2. **Fixed missing fullName in mentee onboarding**
   - confirmation_step wasn't passing provider.fullName to UserDetailModel
   - Updated to include fullName from provider

3. **Fixed missing fullName in mentor registration**
   - Similar issue in mentor_registration_screen
   - Now passes _fullNameController.text to UserDetailModel

# Changelog - [Current Date] - The "Architectural Alignment" Update

## 🚨 CRITICAL BREAKING CHANGES
This update fundamentally changes how data is saved and how the app runs on Web.
**ALL TEAM MEMBERS MUST READ THIS BEFORE MERGING.**

### 1. Architecture Shift: Transactional to State-Based
- **Old Way:** Mentor Registration saved data to Firebase on every "Next" click.
- **New Way:** Data is held in `MentorRegistrationProvider` (RAM) and only saved to Firebase on the final "Submit".
- **Impact:** Prevents "400/404" errors and orphaned documents.

### 2. Web Compatibility (Storage)
- **Removed:** `dart:io` (File) dependencies in upload logic.
- **Added:** `XFile` and `readAsBytes()` + `putData()` for Firebase Storage.
- **Why:** The app now works on Chrome without crashing on `Platform._operatingSystem`.

### 3. Database Standardization (3-Layer Schema)
- **Standardized:** The `user_id` field is now explicitly saved in ALL three collections:
  1. `users` (Public Profile)
  2. `user_details` (Private PII)
  3. `mentor_verifications` (Admin Layer)
- **Fixed:** `DatabaseService` now handles atomic writes for verification documents + file uploads.

### 4. Folder Structure Refactor
- **Renamed/Moved:** `mentor_registration_screen` -> `mentor_registration_page.dart` (The Shell).
- **New Steps:** Individual screens are now lightweight widgets (Step 1-5) inside `lib/presentation/mentor_registration/`.

## ✅ Action Required for Team
1. **DO NOT** overwrite `lib/services/database_service.dart` with your old version.
2. **DO NOT** change `File` back to `dart:io` in any service.
3. **Run** `flutter pub get` immediately after pulling (Dependencies updated).
